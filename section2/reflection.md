## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

  - 1. The idea that no matter how many years you've been doing something there is always an opportunity to learn more and you should never sit back and think 'ok I don't need to learn anything new.'
  - 2. Not to be afraid to ask for help when you need it. There's so  much information out there and everyone will probably know something you don't and vice versa and that's why collaboration is also so important.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
  - I haven't gotten discouraged by making mistakes throughout the Mod 0 project. Some have been simple mistakes such as forgetting to put " " around a string that I immediately roll my eyes at myself but know that will stop the more I practice. And some have required google searches and once fixed I have learned something else along the way.
  - I need to work on the asking others for help part a bit more. I haven't gotten too stuck yet but I know it will happen at some point.
  - I enjoy messing around with the code. I messed with the "Choose a door" exercise for a long time and kept trying to see what else I could do with it.
  - I do tend to look a bit farther forward than I should be and need to concentrate on learning what's in front of me first. I know it will be a bit of a challenge to not compare myself to everyone else in class.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
  - A conditional statement is checking to see if something is true or false. If it's true then it will run the code and if it's false it will move on
  
    - 1. an `if` statement
    - 2. an `if/elsif/else` to check multiple conditions
    - 3. a `case` statement which also checks multiple conditions

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
  - To check to see if a condition is true or false, if the code needs to make a decision on what it needs to do next

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
  - `if (condition)
       action
    end`
  - if this condition is true then do the action

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
  - if you are checking for multiple conditions you start with `if` and then add however many `elsif`s to check other conditions with the final check being `else`.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
  - `if x < y
        puts "x is less than y"
     elsif x > y
        puts "x is more than y"
     else
        puts "x is y"
     end`
